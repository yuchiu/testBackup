This resource allows you to create 'Lightbox' enabled image galleries within your Moodle course.

As a course teacher, you are able to create, edit and delete galleries. Small thumbnails will then be generated, which are used for the thumbnail view of the gallery.
Clicking on any of the thumbnails brings that image into focus, and allows you to scroll through the gallery at your leisure. Using the Lightbox scripts creates nice transition effects when loading and scrolling through the images.
