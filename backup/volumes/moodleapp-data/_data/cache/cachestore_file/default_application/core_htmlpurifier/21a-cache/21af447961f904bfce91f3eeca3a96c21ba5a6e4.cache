s:2306:"<p>The Adaptive Quiz activity enables a teacher to create quizes that efficiently measure the takers' abilities. Adaptive quizes are comprised  of questions selected from the question bank that are tagged with a score of their difficulty. The questions are chosen to match the estimated ability level of the  current test-taker. If the test-taker succeeds on a question, a more challenging question is presented next. If the test-taker answers a question incorrectly, a less-challenging question is presented next. This technique will develop into a sequence of questions converging on the test-taker's effective ability level. The quiz stops when the test-taker's ability is determined to the required accuracy.</p>

<p>This activity is best suited to determining an ability measure along a unidimensional scale. While the scale can be very broad, the questions must all provide a measure of ability or aptitude on the same scale. In a placement test for example, questions low on the scale that novices are able to answer correctly should also be answerable by experts, while questions higher on the scale should only be answerable by experts or a lucky guess. Questions that do not discriminate between takers of different abilities on will make the test ineffective and may provide inconclusive results.</p>

<p>Questions used in the Adaptive Quiz must</p>

<ul><li>be automatically scored as correct/incorrect</li>
<li>be tagged with their difficulty using 'adpq_' followed by a positive integer that is within the range for the quiz</li>
</ul><p>The Adaptive Quiz can be configured to</p>

<ul><li>define the range of question-difficulties/user-abilities to be measured. 1-10, 1-16, and 1-100 are examples of valid ranges.</li>
<li>define the precision required before the quiz is stopped. Often an error of 5% in the ability measure is an appropriate stopping rule</li>
<li>require a minimum number of questions to be answered</li>
<li>require a maximum number of questions that can be answered</li>
